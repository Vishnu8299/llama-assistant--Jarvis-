User: create a program to print while loop in Python
AI: A new challenge!

Here's the Python code for a basic while loop:

```
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print("Hello, Vishnu!")
    i += 1
```

This code will print "Hello, Vishnu!" five times. You can modify the condition in the `while` statement and the increment/decrement value to suit your needs.

Run this code in a Python interpreter or save it to a file with a `.py` extension and run it using Python, like this: `python while_loop_example.py`.
