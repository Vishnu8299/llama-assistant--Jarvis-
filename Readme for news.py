Groq API Chatbot
This project demonstrates how to use the Groq API to create a simple chatbot that generates completions based on user input. The script connects to the Groq API using an API key and sends a message to the chatbot model to get a response.

Prerequisites
Python 3.12 or higher
Groq Python package
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Environment Variable
The GROQ_API_KEY environment variable must be set for the script to work. You can set it in your terminal session as follows:

Windows (PowerShell)

powershell
Copy code
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Linux/macOS

bash
Copy code
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Alternatively, you can set it permanently in your system's environment variables.

4. Update and Run the Script
Ensure the script pdf.py is configured correctly with the model name and message content. The script file should look like this:

python
Copy code
import os
from groq import Groq

# Fetch the API key from the environment variable
client = Groq(
    api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-3",  # Use an appropriate model name
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
Run the script using:

bash
Copy code
python news.py
Troubleshooting
Environment Variable Not Found: If the environment variable GROQ_API_KEY is not recognized, ensure it is set correctly in your terminal session or system environment variables.
Model Not Found: If you encounter a model_not_found error, verify that you are using a valid model name and that your API key has access to it.
Dependencies: Ensure all required Python packages are installed. Check requirements.txt and run pip install -r requirements.txt if necessary.
